"Meta is Garbage is GarbageWhen did this become a thing? I presume it came out as a reaction to the giant wave a few years back of everyone doing nothing but meta reads (which was also a bit daft) but I'd like to at least discuss some of my issues with the so-called meta issue that I see a lot.First off, the 'people can change their meta' argument. To that I say, yes, and? People (scum) can game *any and every tell in the book* that's kind of the point of being good scum, doing whatever you can to appear town. Insomuch as I have a scum meta, it is to have it look as much like my town meta as possible, so, yeah, naturally players can and will and should do whatever they can to match metas, just as they should do it to affect any possible tell around. So the idea that scum will attempt to manipulate a tell applies equally across all tells, yeah? Unless the tell is actually objective (and the only ones I've personally found like that tend to be mechanic and voting based - so...y'know, stuff like setup spec and VCA that people *also* whine about. So, first off, this is a dumb complaint when someone uses meta as a tell.""Meta is garbage!"" This is another I hear a lot. I presume people say this because they've seen meta be wrong. Okay, whoop-de-doo, I'm pretty sure I've seen every tell under the sun be wrong. The real question is simply how well supported/researched is the meta being used. Is it from one game? Then maybe it's garbage. Is it from a five year history and 10+ games? Then I'd be awfully willing to buy it (and generally have never experienced people doing a drastic meta shift in some random game to break their meta and own face). So, once again, this makes meta...wait for it...basically like every tell out there.""I change my meta every game, so I can't be meta'ed"" I would suggest this implies you're a bad player, unless your claim is all town game styles are equally effective (and if you think that I'd love to discuss your research and conclusions). I also...well, kinda don't believe this, and even if it is exactly true - then that's your meta, and theoretically tells could be drawn from it even then.So, basically, stop random attacking meta for empty reasons. If you have an issue with a meta case, describe them. If you can't, then it's probably a perfectly valid case as far as the style the case-maker has chosen.Also, saying you hate meta is your meta - change it Also leaving this here

You think it's a valid attack?One instance of identifying something as scum-indicative in common with you is enough to get them into prob-town territory, is it? If you could re-summarize the case on Allomancer, I would appreciate it. I think many of the things you find scummy in his posts are not ones I do; and I am in part vaguely informed by past experience with Allo. Since you like having all evidence, I would suggest you read other towngames of his.  Overall, I am OK with whoever is lynched as long as the townbloc has consensus on it; but at this point I strongly advocate Eve to be in the cop-bloc if not the lynch.I think Skitter is town. However, not even close to how much I would have to promote her to the townbloc. She agrees with you about Eve being mislynch bait. Do you not see town equity from that, as similar mindsets about things seems to be a strong +town indicator for you?Skitter didn't respond to my case for 1/0. I see that as a sign of acceptance.

I voted her to test that, and her lack of pushback is interesting. The lilith head I think asked someone about an obvious joke, and the quote I posted is a general rule of thumb.

"RVS Doesn't Mean You're Supposed to be RandomOkay...how do I say this without coming across more pompous than usual...I...I think that a vast majority of players of Mafia are fething lackwits who don't know what they're supposed to do at game start.Yeah, that about sums it up. Sadly.Look, the term RVS does stand for 'Random Voting Stage'. Yes, I get that. I understand. However, the reason it was called that was because to outsiders/newbies back in the day seeing it for the first time it *appeared* random. It was anything but. Really, what it should be called is LIVS, 'low information voting stage'. You don't have a lot of info available, and, yeah, maybe your first vote reasons are indeed because you hate someone's avatar. but you're (theoretically) placing that vote to see reactions to it. Who else votes that player? Who avoids voting them? Who tries to build a wagon? Who avoids this? How does the player react to your vote? Who do they vote? All of that, ALL OF IT, is information, info for the town to assess both Day 1 and later in the game.What RVS is *not* is a stage where you're supposed to dork around doing nothing for whatever arbitrary amount of pages you think are supposed to be the ""fun"" pages. That's called pre and post game. Once voting starts the game has started. You're allowed (and I suppose, encouraged) to have fun. I usually do myself. But I *don't* support having fun to the detriment of scumhunting, because that is stupid.Your vote isn't random. You have placed it for a reason and so has everyone else.The more you try to make it random the more you are helping scum, because scum like low information voting, because it helps them. Which day do scum have the most ability to mislynch town? Day 1 - due to lack of info.Therefore, the only sane thing, the only pro-town thing, the only good play thing to do - IS TO PREVENT THE LOW INFORMATION STAGE FROM LASTING ANY LONGER THAN IT HAS TO.Or...I guess you can have ""fun"" and joke, and fight any wagons simply because you apparently don't know how to use PMs or a General thread, or a signup thread, or post game to interact with players you like.RVS isn't random.Get over your silly selves.

"You can't have claimed Saint because you had already claimed Not Outsider. As Minion, yes, it would've been good play to claim Saint much earlier - that even prevents Fire from getting confirmed! And the resulting paranoia means town doesn't want to execute you, and you can tailor your play to get scummier and scummier with time, and perhaps eat up the LyLo execution to hand your team the win... oh my, that would have been exciting to watch.

			",town,botc
"As Minion you'd *want* to get executed as the game goes on though! You eat up one of the available executions, and therefore it's a pretty fine idea to play the jester.

"Well, a huge reason for the pocket was my very strong belief in Skitter being the Minion! Outside of that I would've been way more comfortable with the idea that you were Minion in my head. Even then, I read it as A50+Nahdia, so I didn't really care much; but if it's A50+Elements then I was pretty wrong Skitter, why would you waste an execution on A50 when we could've had consecutive shots on Nahdia and Elements for the win  I basically took that as a scumclaim from you

			",town,botc
"It's kinda evident that Nahdia's scum now, no?I just quickly jotted down notes, anyway:1. What is Elements' partner doing? A50 doesn't even seem to care much, he left that vote as a favor to me and then retracted it anyway. Absolutely no panic in this thread apart from me. 2. Skitter voted Elements inspite of their townread with a ""ahhhhhhhh sorry :/"", conveniently forgot that a Minion execution was a waste last day, and that Nahdia+A50 makes much more mechanical sense than Elements today3. Skitter jumped on Elements' weird play (which I can't defend easily) pretty aggressively, and is way too comfortable with her vote 4. Why do you guys suppose the Undertaker was killed N1 over the Monk? Imp was more afraid of Drixx's ""Chef or drunk"" result when Skitter had 0 neighboring pairs as a result, over a Monk who could negate any NK? (Hint: if Skitter was Minion, Drixx's result would've made it much harder for the scumteam)5. Nahdia nominated Skitter D1, BUT she soft defended Skitter during that nomination phase pretty hard. She panicked, and also requested a private thread just with Skitter. Fishy, no?6. Nahdia requested a PT with Skitter only again the next day. Outside of LyLo these were the only 2-person requests outside the IC. 7. I was creating self-associations with Nahdia today and both Drixx and Elbirn got  , Skitter didn't even react to it8. Skitter apparently did some meta study, but comes out with nothing convincing? The best she's got is something along the lines of Nahdia's play being different from other scumgames, and Ame's scumrange being broader than she thought.

(On a side note, I'm not joking: wins/losses don't mean much to me after the game, while being entertained leaves me a great feeling of satisfaction. I was in a game a few months ago where I correctly townblocc'd and then one guy in it -- a gunsmith -- decided to commit and go all-in on a fake guilty on my other townbloc member. He got lynched, I got nuked, then his fake guilty got lynched, then scum won soon after. A proper demonstration of gamethrowing. But it's one of my favourite games lol, it was absolutely hilarious how all of this had gone down. The person who declared the fake guilty and earnestly asked town to lynch it after he died dropped into the dead thread saying ""obviously I was lying"", I lost it)

			",town,botc
"Alternatively, you can come up with a {Auro+Elements} solve if it hasn't been mechanically eliminated, and you automatically have both Elbirn's and Drixx's votes!

"He's playing anti wincon as both alignments if it's intentional. The easier explanation is that he's misunderstood. And that fits pretty consistently with nom+thinking there are three lynches left.

"There is; this is the logic I used yesterday. Kept Nahdia around for her results while also scumreading her.

"Because he believes there are three lynches left and thinks Ame is quite clearly scum/useless?What's the scum motivation for doing that nom? To distract town for a day?

"Well, it's not the most  I've seen this game, for sure

"As Demon also he's trolling at the potential expense of a loss, no? Versus staying mum and say, letting me drive a lynch towards someone.

"Demon? NMinion? N but maybe looking at his trolling around

			",town,botc
"Elements, do you also feel that Skitter and Nahdia are trying to brute force plausibility of certain scenarios? Skitter basically just repeated ""I think A50 is scum, makes most sense with Drixx"" when I showed how that's not really plausible.

"So instead of trying to maneuver his way out of it, he leaves the game to his mechanically conflicted partner A50 to carry to endgame... Because he's scared that we would PoE him... C'mon now

			",town,botc
"I am not. The most likely universe according to me is {Skitter Poisoner + Nahdia Demon} with Ame being Drunk and I'm N0 poisoned. Nahdia has constantly requested a private thread with just Skitter, both D1 and D2. Skitter constantly acknowledges Nahdia is less townie than others, but never wants her lynched. Do you have a reason to believe this isn't a valid scenario?

			",town,botc
"Drixx, who would you vote for in a LyLo with {Nahdia, Elbirn, Elements}?

			",town,botc
"Nahdia: If A50's lynched and game doesn't end, you would vote Elements in LyLo, correct? Skitter, so would you?

			",town,botc
"This is an unhealthy attitude to have; one should always keep in mind that they're not accurate 100% of the time; ignoring someone because you scumread them is one thing, but asking everyone else to ignore them is another.

			",town,botc
"Yes, because I have reasons to townread all of them. Probably I'll just screw it and town lynches A50?

			",town,botc
"Skitter, this means you honestly believe that it is likely I just guessed A50 must be Scarlet Woman and then got myself lynched?

			",town,botc
"So what does the Elbirn Spy, Elements Demon universe mean?

			",town,botc
"I've covered the cases. If you lynch A50 and the game doesn't end, who would you use your final vote on? As long as it's Nahdia and not Elbirn/Elements I'll be happy. Can you commit to it?

			",town,botc
"Actually yeah you can eliminate Elbirn. Elements or A50, and I dunno - I'd lean towards Elements I guess. You being the Demon sits much better in my head.

			",town,botc
"It's going to be very hard deciding in LyLo between Elements, A50, Elbirn.

			",town,botc
"I encourage town voters to engage with me upon why Nahdia is the best lynch; please do not blame me for ""poor communication"" if you guys lynch A50 and Elements or something and we lose the game 

			",town,botc
"So the likeliest scenario is one where A50 chucks the fake claims he's given, claims something else, then changes his claim to one that prevents him from killing himself, while I claim a role that'll fail instead of something that makes me look towny (since I know all roles)...?

			",town,botc
"My thoughts

"I just think the rest are townier or not Demon

"Skitter, you'd be in favor of lynching Nahdia? You also think she's scum, no?

"Ame Demon, Elbirn Spy, Nahdia Drunk is a possibility.

I correctly townread him, and hard defended him despite his continued tunnel on me, and offered my own lynch instead of his so town could lynch my scumread in LyLo. Here, A50 is Minion at best. We have three shots regardless of whether the Minion is alive. We need to lynch the Demon. We also get soft confirmation via Nahdia's check. We need to lynch the Demon. That's the goal of the game.

"Not strictly, but as I said, a loose equivalency can be established.For example - you said Elbirn and I should be chain lynched and the argument that I should prefer my own death would equally apply to Elbirn since his role is inactive; but ""probability"" dictates that there's a legitimate chance either of us is Drunk causing the shot to fail (there was a number attached, but that doesn't matter) leaving a plausible chance of a 3-2 LyLo where a single misfire can lose the game from an external perspective, and from my perspective a more definite chance if Elbirn is town; sure, you could argue that active roles can account for skewing the probability of a LyLo misfire, but I would suggest that the presence of minion power derives back balance enough to make it worse than random chance. You claim that basic probability argues this; but where are the numbers? Sure, it's not strictly applicable to the game situation I proposed, but would be darn similar in principle - where there are a bunch of cops (active roles) and I'm a VT (expendable role) and yet, if EV decreases on my lynch as opposed to a random D1 lynch, it would only prove that there is personal value in not dying inspite of being inactive with other active roles present. It's the principle I am arguing for, and applying back to this scenario. If there's something very different here that shows us why the I cannot apply it, then you haven't shown one!

"I had explained it, no? I was fully willing to discuss the reasoning behind every assertion of mine. The person who nominated me cut that discussion short, and said ""we're going in circles"". You're saying you would've also gone ahead and yolo nominated me if not him. I was actively discussing with A50. I had been reticent with a few thoughts since I didn't want to guide scum play, too. Of course nothing can be considered without WIFOM. I'm not demanding to be lock townread. BUT, everything is WIFOM. Any act I do can be put under a WIFOM lens. My argument is that this particular strategy I followed has a poor payoff when I'm scum, as I risk a CC as Minion and am locking into my claim in either case, and there's a non zero chance I lose credibility when a nomination fails - and an even higher chance of my losing credibility if a *self-nomination* fails. My argument is that the reward here doesn't make sense weighed against the risk.I disagree that I ""waved my dick"" all around the game, lol. Just because makes informed firm assertions doesn't mean they're being egomaniacal. Your hostility was unnecessary. You have stated that I am either scum or stupid. That is propositioning. You have been trying to derail what is obviously a pro-town strategy. You admitted that you would have yolo nominated me if not Elbirn, which is intent to act. You have done more than ""disagree"" with me, you have been actively hostile, assumed I'm incompetent or scum while not being able to recognize the ideas behind what I was proposing. You have offered only  weak reasoning against my proposed ideas. All of these are actions, and in my opinion, AI. I'm claiming that agreement is likely from town, and hostile disagreement likely from scum. My scumread on you would, in part, logically follow from that conclusion alone. You can call my premise unsound, but I would remind you that scum get screwed over by following that strategy versus town would greatly benefit off of it, and also point you to how the majority reacted (in the predicted town way). If you can find some major holes in that line of reasoning (and highlighting the possibility that town ""can be frustrated"" does not count) be my guest.@Nahdia: note that when that was that was the only reason going for him, I said it wasn't a very reliable townread. At that point, my expectation was that A50 as scum would hesitate to accept my idea instantly - that it would require a lot of thought before he chose to just ""weather the storm"". Instead, he seemed to have read it, not fully understand it, and claim a preliminary acceptance of it. My read strengthened particularly as I read his catch-up. He was actively trying to find the best town utility for my confirmation. He was warming up to the idea of joint confirmation, and then realised it could be better if I self nom. He correctly townread me, and also said he would continue to townread me assuming I'm Drunk or poisoned, it my self-nom failed. When I tried to create the neighborhood of 5, he proposed that instead *I* should create one with you and Skitter and another with the other few (or something to that effect). That thought organically rising (where he wasn't part of either PT in his proposed alternative) is town indicative. His not recognizing the Scarlet Woman's role was also mildly town indicative. Do you agree my reasons to townread him are sound? If not, why so?

			",town,botc
"Again, that math was for the case of random nomination which wasn't what happened in reality, man

"I agree that the random start prior holds. But then there's the fact that he yolo nominated, and also that the action failed. I absolutely agree with the intended conclusion if the nomination was at random (or my pick). I disagree when the nomination is non consensual. Honestly, tell me - is this not supposed to skew the probabilities? Let's say my assertion that scum have high incentive to yolo nominate while town don't (in that they would wait) is high is true. If so, do you agree that my logical conclusion in terms of scumreading him is true? Bayesian probability, no?If you disagree about that assertion, that's a separate talking point.

The goal of the game is to kill the Demon, the Minion is lower value.

"Strategy GuideMy received role is Virgin. I may be Drunk, or Poisoned. I am confirmable if I'm actually un-poisoned Virgin.If everyone trusts that I'm town, I create a PT individually with every other player, and they fess up their role to me in the PT. The Minion does not receive a fakeclaim, and Demon has to communicate it to them - since the only PT they will have is with me, they are forced to choose a claim themselves which may collide with a town role. There's a 40% chance of that happening, which is already beneficial to town!I can piece together information I receive in terms of roles and N0 information they receive, and attempt to logically deduce the identities of the Evil with high accuracy. Even if I cannot, I believe that I can direct night actions towards effective targets, help plan out (or at least listen to) bluffs/gambits privately, and otherwise let the day play out.If you are worrying that I am a scum mastermind taking town along for a ride, I can choose someone to nominate me, or nominate myself. The advantage of the former is that in the case that I'm not drunk or poisoned, we have 2 confirmed town roles (barring the nominator being a Spy, but in that case they ded anyway so woo). The advantage of the latter is that this rules out an Evil person nominating me and thus make me non-confirmable. This will be a waste of one lynch, though, and we have only 2 lynches to waste on town.FAQ1. Auro, breaking the game this way is no fun!We can play the game again later with modified rules.

It's a dominant strategy given the rule tweaks here from usual BoTC.3. Why isn't this a gamebreaking strategy for IRL BoTC?I'd googled for this strategy and turns out I wasn't the first to think of it at all: https://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/22 ... 5#31941945. This addresses certain weaknesses in the strategy.However, there is a major difference between IRL BoTC and forum. IRL BoTC doesn't have unlimited neighborhoods, and is also greatly time-limited. You can see who's whispering to whom. People can't constantly privately talk to the Virgin. None of those are present in this version of BoTC, where I can continuously actively talk and strategize and solve across 8 parallel hoods. Scum will not be able to strategize together, making their job much more difficult. The article also makes some other incorrect assumptions about this strategy which were pointed out in comments.Do NOT create a neighborhood with another player right now.

"Okay. Cephrir was obvtown and thus not a lynch scum could push. Plus, he was sheeping Dann (or) me. You, Dann and I were all  legitimate pushes at the beginning of the day.Of course a Molla/Gob team would lynch Ceph, who else could they?

"Dann and I have both reached the conclusion that Gobbles bad. I don't see that position changing.

"Dude, building a case that looks nuanced is easy. Gobbles is competent enough to do that much. He also had help from teammates.His reads aren't nuanced at all from a big picture level.

			",town,white flag
"FF's play makes sense from the perspective of him being high and being tunnelled on us - his votes on you didn't seem opportunistic, more like he got emotional about perceived hypocrisy in your play. There's also loose evidence for FF!town and this is overweighed by Gobs/Molla's scum equities. I think his Dong vote actually rules out a Dong-FF team, which means Dong has no partners.

"Say I'm scum. If I'm scum with Dann, then Gobbles lynch is game losing for me anyway, because there's no reason for any out of {FF, Gob, Molla} to change their mind.If I'm scum with Dong or someone, then Dann casting a vote on town is what I have to hope for - this is easily resolved by having Dann be the  hammering vote I think.

Still trying to lynch one of us is just dumb for scum!Dong, since he would know we flip town and Gobbles/Molla both want his head. Dong is town. And we're in autoloss because of that.Pick one of me/Dann and you'll get your lynch. You'll have to convince Gobbles or Molla; I doubt they would both refuse for long. I'm not going to self-vote or vote Dann on principle. If Dong is somehow scum and playing a yolo strategy, it will become apparent in LyLo anyway for reasons. On a selfish, personal level I'd rather you get me lynched because that leaves Dann to try and win LyLo.

			",town,white flag
"Can you show me what discounts a Molla-Gobbles team? They are pursuing a common agenda overall, have taken mildly different stances on things like Dann lynch; Molla gave some reasons Gob could be scum but has been defending him when Gob's actually in danger. The constant appeals to create graphs would've been scummy if there was no daytalk, but the presence of daytalk makes me wonder why Molla would ask in game thread instead of the PT.

			",town,white flag
"Well I don't townread him at all. Dann was, but after re-evaluating I don't think he did either. Less scummy compared to other slots but still not a townread I think.

			",town,white flag
"Okay here's a case. I can devote some time to build a more comprehensive case on Gobbles after a few hours (I've been posting from office and I have a deadline on Monday), but I think you know my reasons on a high level anyway.

			",town,white flag
"What? Did this mean his teammates were pitching in, etc? Dong, explain?

			",town,white flag
"Cheeky, if you leave both Auro/Dann alive it's likely we're pushed as the LyLo solve and I don't trust town in that set to realize otherwise; meaning the prior of a scum flip becomes more important. Looking at today's play I don't see Dong flipping scum; versus my high degree of confidence in Gob scum and Dann affirming it after a read through. *If* Gob flips town, oh well.

			",town,white flag
"I don't think he *opposed* it vehemently, seemed like posturing... Wasn't Dann at L-1 before and Gob hadn't voted?

			",town,white flag
"One reason I wanted you to obtain FF/Dong's assurance that they'd not vote me in LyLo was to observe Gob/Molla's reaction  and see if they then hop on to a Dann/Auro lynch.

			",town,white flag
"That's a good question. Although lynching Dann can still make LyLo hell for a Molla/Gob team: they leave me to LyLo and have to hope that Dong/FF don't re-evaluate based on Dann's flip and final words; or they kill me and then you sheep mine and Dann's solve. It's a generally tough position to fight from IF Dong/FF begin to reevaluate. Lynching Dong would have much higher payoff since the Auro/Dann solve would be pretty juicy to pursue at LyLo.

			",town,white flag
"Actually Dong/Molla isn't either I think, need to check~Dong individually has a lot of scum equity but the lack of viable partners majorly makes him town or not worth lynching I think

			",town,white flag
"I think Dong/FF is not the scumteam, at least. Dong/Gobbles also isn't one. FF/Gob is possible but there reasons to believe FF is town.

			",town,white flag
"I think you've mentioned intent to kill him multiple times after Dunn died. Pocketing you helps indirectly when you're paranoid of Auro or Dann.

			",town,white flag
"Gamestate wise, if you, Dann and I bloc together Dong is the only viable push they have. Dong's trajectory is purely attacking me though, he hasn't even considered a lynch option within the other three. Kinda ballsy for FF-Dong to plan to just come into the day voting me and pushing me that strong when they know I'm on to Gobbles, they could've just wait a bit to see how things played out.

			",town,white flag
"As Dann pointed out, it looks pretty much like a pocketing attempt? And the busywork in crafting that post can help give townpoints too.

			",town,white flag
"I think there are more ""bad things"" he's done; including the random AtE post when we wagoned him, his lack of nuance in reads today, the skew in effort put to meta-townread you compared to other reads, etc.

			",town,white flag
"I know that you outed a Hydra and know that you said there were games where his play has been the ""exact same"". When I say ""explain"", I mean talk in terms of notable characteristics from his town games that he's replicating here; and to strengthen them check that they're lacking in his scum games.

			",town,white flag
"""Posting more gives scum info"" is very unhelpful but I doubt I can carry any useful engagement with FF anyway. Dong is still a wildcard, if he somehow magically changes his mind we get four votes on Gobbles. Else, we'll have to fall back to lynching one of me or Dann. No Lynch wouldn't work out because we'd end up with the same gamestate except without you, with the same number of votes required and the same Auro/Dann tunnels. I think in this particular case it could actually have a higher payoff to lynch one of me/Dann. That should be a last resort if neither of FF/Dong (or Molla if he's actually town) change their mind though.

			",town,white flag
"I personally think FF could be pressed more on the Gob read. You've also played with Gobbles town - so you guys view his meta differently. FF says he thinks Gob is town from meta experience but doesn't detail how. If FF's town, I think that once he attempts to explain or put the meta differences into words he might change his read on the slot.

			",town,white flag
"To realize what makes Gobbles scum, look at any of his town games - even the ones he linked that were ""bad"" and then see what he's doing here. His level of effort as town is much higher than it has been this game. Molla keeps asking for graphs, you know why? He's actually gone through the effort of creating activity based graphs manually previously as town, to figure out scum. What deeper thought processes is he displaying here? All the previous pages seem to have done little to change his conclusion. The maximum change in his stances is to ""unsure"".  Sure.He isn't busy. He's been given every opportunity to get into the game. I refuse to believe he's town and ""in a confused position"" and hence not playing. What he's doing is strategic lurking - the bare minimum to appear generic towny while town eats itself. His final solve of ""Auro/Dong, otherwise Dann/Dong"" without substantiation is scummy for Gob. Gob has been nommed for brilliant town play I think - so this is very weird, right?--To see why Molla is scum, simply look at the trajectory he's taking with me. He finds it insane that I believe his scum play is baseline competent. I should believe he's town, because his scum play is apparently shit and he's out of that range. Feel free to fact check if he's indeed a shit-tier scumplayer. Nothing Molla done has struck me as towny this game. His ""Auro+Dong"" solve is bad. His considering that Auro+Gobbles is a team is horrible. His agenda is pretty transparent. He's accused me of being scum with Dann, Dong and Gobble. Basically any town lynch today, he can justify voting me in LyLo. He wants to make sure my lynch is followed by a Dong lynch - check the top of this page. His defense of Gobbles in D2 was weird af, please re-read the posts. That's not the usual area where Molla gets emotional. He doesn't give that much of a shit if a townread of his is being wagoned on D2 *after* a scum lynch. Consider the counter hypothetical. Would he care if his partner was being wagoned to death? No shit? Obviously he'd have to come in and defend his partner - there was too much momentum to start an attack elsewhere. The AtE in those pages is extreme. He asks to be lynched instead because town is so shit. Yet, he acknowledges that there are valid points for scum Gob. He admits his read of Gob is from ""gut"" from a few posts. He's continually asking Gobbles for graphs because he thinks that that will get Gobbles townread. He isn't bothering much to interact with Gobbles to strengthen his gut read. --You can also approach this via PoE. Dann is pretty obvtown and the only partner I can see for him is Gobbles otherwise. Dann's put in an incredible effort this game and that's sort of unnecessary. The night kills make absolutely zero sense for Dann to have made - it's very suboptimal from a strategical viewpoint. His votes on NSG were awkward and not in a way that makes you feel he doesn't want her lynched. Scum bussing doesn't go CFD ""fuck it, yolo""  at the end of the day. Cheeky's progressions, while wild, still hold internal consistency - I doubt she would be able to fake all that. She's town. FormerFish has been paying zero attention to the game, evidently. Yes, some of his views are inconsistent. I think that's within FF's town range. I believe that this level of poor play is actually towny for him. Again, if he's scum... He's not with Dong. I believe he was genuinely not keeping track of votes. There's not been a single instance showing that he did. He's town. Dongempire's made bad pushes which look like a scum agenda... But who can he even be partners with? It seems to have been a common feature throughout this game that when I defend someone they suddenly become my partner and thus have to be lynched. Dann alleged the same about Hopkirk yesterday when I defended him. Both Gobbles and Molla are saying it now. Dongempire's reaction to the fakehammer seems to come from town over scum knowing it was a fakehammer. He isn't bothering a lot about his own lynch. He's angry that I said Molla will hammer me, and that comes from town. Meanwhile, everyone else is fine voting him for whatever reasons. He's town. This leaves Gobbles and Molla. --My townreading Dong is bad for the gamestate from Gobbles+Molla PoV. That's why both of them say I'm Dong's partner; to rubbish and discredit my townread.

" @3292: Yes, ""derp hammers"" are scummy and you believed so when you asked me to lynch FF if Gobbles flipped town. If you believed it at that point, I don't see why you don't believe I believe town would believe it after a Cheeky NK. They wouldn't need to 'buy my crap' (in this case, Dann's); they literally would not arrive at the conclusion that FF would NK you on N2 over N3, and this doesn't logically imply that Dann is scum magically. I note that you're not being honest in your conversation with me - if you're treating whatever I say as scum ""saying bullshit"", I'm afraid that trying to make you realize my perspective is vain. If all this is for 'why not Dann' post an Auro town flip, then I don't see the point in treating my arguments like they come from scum. @3293: That is not a strong factor by itself - I believe (2) is a lot stronger than (1) and this would come under (1). Yes, it is still a factor for town!FF, and I also believe there are other reasons contributing to town!FF;  however not very strong. Still, if I'm right about you and Dann being town, this implies both scum in {FF, Dong, Gobbles, Molla}; and we only need to eliminate *one* pairing to have a guaranteed win. BB+FF is the least likely pairing within this 4 for reasons that have been covered before, and that suggests a Gobbles-&gt;Dong lynch order. This also works with the fact that FF and Molla have lesser scum equities than Dong and Gobbles.@3294: Again, see above. It's a factor, but a relatively much weaker one compared to the example of FF not killing you, given no one has been really listening to me, instead suspecting me.@3295 : I didn't call it WIFOM bullshit, I called it lies. We don't have ""versions"" of ""memories"", I've posted literal quotes that the dead NKs scumread you. Yes, you can claim that there are better night kills for you in {Auro/Dann/Cheeky} and that would hold some weight. No, you can't say ""But they were all townreading me!"" and not be called out on it. I am running through different situations, yes... it's called gamesolving. FF, if you're trying to make logical arguments with me, please run them by Reundo first. If he calls them stupid/moronic, making these arguments against me in thread is pointless; that saves both my time/energy and yours. Cheeky, I will stop engagement with you at this point - while I do have a lot of patience, this can't go on forever. While you say you want to see things from my perspective, there's a clear gap in communication (or) you're being dense.

"I'm not being obtuse. By your own admission, you've acted ""batshit scummy"". If Dann reacts by pushing you, it's scummy since he declared a strong TR... yet, when I react by not pushing you it's scummy since I'm forced into a strong TR? Can you see how your reasoning fails at this point? If you're acting ""batshit scummy"" and this includes stuff like self-voting AtE, I don't blame Dann.  It's unlikely that scum!Dann predicts that you act all scummy today and give plausible reason to want to lynch you; hence my reasoning still stands.

I'm sure anyone would believe scum!FF kills you D2 and not D3. Do you want to test me on this? Simply ask the rest of town whether they agree.

You've been suspect about literally every slot, and your last posts in the day were you arguing with me that I'd go for FF if a Gobbles lynch didn't end the game. If you were NK'd, do you think town would go ""Oh my, this implicates Dann for sure!""? Do you think Ceph would've believed that? It's 4 to lynch, each extra vote for scum is valuable. I don't think Dann would believe that killing you raises suspicion on him, and I don't think Dann would believe that you're a viable lynch option that could be kept around. The negative impact of keeping you alive (your paranoia of Dann, his  declared lock read on you, lack of a reliable sheep vote) far outweighs the benefits of keeping Ceph alive (not paranoid of Dann, free sheep vote, uninvolved); even *if* there was a chance that your NK would arouse Dann suspicion, that's negligible in front of the advantages, and easily defended against (""Night Kills are meaningless!"").

Additionally, that was a sanity test on Dann. I've explained that your succeeding lynch if you had gotten me lynched early was insurance against your play. Yes, I have a whole bunch of reasons to townread you. Yet, keeping your vote on me long enough to have someone hammer me would be so bad that it would override my reasons to have townread you. I don't want to get unnecessarily paranoid for the same reasons I don't want to get paranoid of Dann. My desired Gobbles lynch takes care of a Cheeky+Gobbles team.

			",town,white flag
"Well, I'll explain how I'm seeing things currently. We have two lynches.FF, Gobbles, and Dong all have very high scum equity. Molla's been townier of late, but still has decent scum equity. Dann has considerable town equity for a multitude of reasons. There's no single post that sticks out as hard town - I think Dann can fake towny posts as scum easily. Instead, look at his play from a holistic perspective. Night Kills aren't completely meaningless. Scum doesn't carry out random NKs. Dann making those night kills as scum sounds like a pretty bad idea for him, especially in White Flag. Think about it. Scum!Dann would, in addition to not being lynched himself, have to defend his partner from a lynch. Cephrir was a low-involvement town slot that lock town read Dann and would happily sheep him in later days. At the same time, Dann also knows that you're constantly paranoid of him. He also knows that other town slots are suspecting him. What would scum!Dann do in this situation? NK Cephrir, and then fight off scumreads by himself while hoping to get town cred via WIFOM? That is a very bad strategy for scum!Dann. Remember how I said that if you had lynched me early, that's such poor town play from you that I would instead believe you're scum? The same logic works in reverse here, and in a stronger way -- the NK would be such poor scum play from Dann (an otherwise competent scum player) that I'd instead believe he's town.If there's any other reason you think is too vague for you to see for yourself, I can detail.

Reasons not to stoke paranoia about him, for me, is that if he IS scum, he must have a partner in {FF,Dong,Gobble,Molla}; and I'd rather scum!Dann take the win than all the lurkers and town derps creating noise with inane behavior.

"""Slimey""? I assumed it was a scumgame for some reason when I read the ISO. I was very surprised at the effort he put in and how obvtown he seemed to me. He was actually town there. One primary characteristic in this game, and other towngames is the presence of meaningful engagement - his pushes all seem very real. I don't see any empty/""bad"" questions. He follows up on responses, with more questions or with a vote, etc. His play here is starkly different not just in terms of activity but the kind of engagement and thought processes he shows in his posts. His questions are mostly busywork. He's fixated on details that have occured way in the past. His solve that scum are in ""first tier townreads"" is incongruent with his tone - town thinking this wouldn't relax if they actually believed this, especially when said ""first tier townreads but actually scum"" are baying for their blood.

Because the NK'd slots didn't townread him. Even the lynched slots didn't - look at 2748, 2763 for example.""Auro wants to hear my teammate's opinions as a desperate out"" (3023): Incorrect. It's so that I can read FF better. I've detailed how it would in 3051. Asking for a teammate's opinion on something is not a legitimate basis for scumreading someone.

From a theory standpoint I side with you, and yet what made me facepalm was not that I felt Auro was being disingenuous, it was him being seemingly so genuinely obstinate for the umpteenth time despite me not agreeing.

"The attack on me? Cool, let me summarize. Esp thinks I'm asking questions in a manner as to get out of being scumread, instead of trying to work with people. My push against this was that I always do this, it helps me form reads on people, and I can get people to sheep me if they stop scumreading me. Cephrir thinks the same, and my defense is the same. He thinks I'm spending 'too much time' on contesting scumreads on me, and my 'defensiveness' is major scummy. My push against this was the same as above.You think the same, that I'm picking 'small points of contention' and 'magnifying' them, which feels 'forced and fake'. My push against this is again the same; helps me form reads and I do this all the time. So what's going on? We have three people making the *same* attack which is weakened massively by a very simple look at any of my non-hydra towngames (I'm not as active in hydra games because it's a pain to keep logging in ), and I'm not finding it trivial to distinguish between town thickness and scum disingenuousness.Pedit: Pushes I made in game so far:1. Push on FF: For lack of game-advancing content in the then ~30 posts.2. Push on Dong: More of a reaction test than a proper push.3. Push on Cephrir: For repeated show of disinterest in the game, unwillingness to meaningfully engage with players, statements he couldn't substantiate (""my teammates scumread Auro"")4. Push on Esp: For coasting on an Auro push with little content about other players, lack of willingness to re-assess based on new evidence, disingenuous arguments.

NSG being easily detectable as scum helps my reasoning, in that she wouldn't pose a major threat to town early game. I don't think distancing happens this early in a White Flag game, especially if your teammate's being pushed by multiple people. (Regarding Gob vs Joan)Yeah, learned a lot from my vote hopping, I've explained my trajectories on various slots - are you even reading my posts?You'll also discover I moved off Ceph (although I don't quite want to), being dismissive and uncooperative is easy for scum to hide behind. The ""attacking townread of yours shouldn't make them scum"" argument has been repeated ad nauseam in this game and is frankly a huge stretch from ""minus points"".

Nowhere does it mean it's a solid unchanging read. As to the latter argument, the majority of the game is going to be town, so anyone I push is more likely going to be town than scum anyway, no? 3.

The most useful meta tool is to evaluate the AI-ness of actions. Say, I linked to previous games to affect my reads -&gt; You thought I was scummy for that this game. Next game, I do the same, you'll say ""Oh Auro did this as town, therefore it's NAI"", right?

It simply means the less probable happened. Get it?@Mini: I totally agree, except the 'quickhammer' was barely a few hours before deadline, and Snowbeast already flaked by then. The correct action then is to lunch through the claim, which means the claim itself is irrelevant. Lunching a doctor is worse than not lunching, but you're biased because you had information on Snow being the doc. To a town without that information, lunching is the correct step.Nah, it's good to use investigative roles on such people, as I said. N_M's calling out my wagon as being scum-motivated and some other posts deservedly gave him townie points. I would've jailkept him otherwise if he was at null. Otherwise we'd always end up wasting a mislunch on Not_Mafia type people.

			",town,newbie 1900
"I wasn't defending him. Your reason for scumreading him was ""I didn't like his iso"", right? Let's put it this way -- if he was town, would you have not disliked his ISO? I was damn sure you'd hate his ISO regardless of his alignment, which is still valid, and thus it wasn't a defense of him -- it was an assertion that your scumread on him was not justified.Take any previous game of his, show me his day 1 ISO from that game, and tell me how you read him off that. If you can consistently scum/townread him off D1 ISOs, I'll gladly concede. Auro saying ""Your case on X is bad"" is NOT Auro defending X.It's just Auro saying the case on X is bad. 

			",town,newbie 1900
"See, just because someone's in a teaching role doesn't mean they have to play to hard defined ""good town play!"" rules. Hammering at a time when there's no point in a claim, like a few hours before the deadline, is completely reasonable.  Anyway, waiting for FL's own opinions on all this.

			",town,newbie 1900

We pointed it out in the dead thread and Ariane did bring it up, but no one pushed him on it! FL got away with a lot of dead-people-misrep. I wish I stayed to future days  2. Snowbeast's correct play would've been to claim Doc much earlier when he was starting to get wagoned. I was null-scumming FL then, and I think he was a viable lunch -- we still would've gotten rid of some variable that day. I might have also considered lunching Volxen through the claim because of multiple reasons, hmm.3. Killing Ariane was a weird play, FL would've had a much easier win if he went through with that IMO. If Performer had a slightly more charismatic tone and made stronger arguments, town would've lunched FL. 4. Why would Performer not NK Not_Mafia, given N_M scumreads him easily? This is something that should've been picked up much earlier, the possible WIFOM is definitely not worth it.5. Lamees, our playstyles are pretty different -- Next time please engage with me more on specifics so I can sort you better?  6.

Of course that's for town to judge, IMO there'd be a lot more content off me to make reads than my own early thoughts on someone's case to read me upon.

A ""Quickhammer"" is when someone places the final vote without stating intent, thus risking the loss of a PR - which is anti-town. Not_Mafia is known for quickhammers, so if you're placing the pre-final vote on someone, he could hammer them immediately. Since it's part of his playstyle, he can't be sorted on the basis of it either. Therefore, considering the possibility of that, placing someone at L-1 is equivalent to lynching them.

Maybe the manufacturers changed that for the robots they released? No one knows.One thing always bothered me, though. What if I was one of them? What if I wasn't born a simple, free, human; but a bloodthirsty robot who lacked any true identity? This single thought had always taken a backseat in my mind. It increasingly began to have a greater effect on my daily life, leading to an eventual obsession. I could not invest my energies in anything else, and lost everything I had.When I was offered a chance to 'volunteer' for the experiment, I was told that I would know my identity -- whether I was human, or a bot --- before the experiment started. Apparently RandomAccess, one of the volunteers, had failed to read his instruction card (a malfunctioning robot or an unwilling human, there was no point keeping him) and I replaced him instead. Miss Star repeated the instructions for me, and guided me to the glass room. I saw that most others had taken their cards from the tesseract table, and proceeded to take my own and read it.I breathed a sigh of relief. I finally knew what I was. Or to be more precise, who I am.And then it hit me that if I did not find out which ones were the M.A.F.I.A, I'd... probably die anyway. I had a good, hard look around the room. I recognized a few of the volunteers - Lamees, Volxen, and Not_Mafia, from before. Volxen's avatar looked like what they called a ""Transformer"" to me. A sentient robot.

These 'talking points' don't really give an insight into who he's town/scumreading, except for DVa (""the whole scumchat thing's already been said multiple times""). I'm curious how he was reading DVa off this but null-reads tictac.Now in 241, he expresses doubt over his tictac vote because of the null-read, but is unsure about moving his vote to a slot he scumreads (""or actually idk there's nothing bad about early pressure""). He offers no real opinions on the DVa|A50|tictac exchange through all this.

One's effectively a policy lynch, and the other (tictac) has two random votes, is weakly scumread by a few of us, and is A50/Not_Mafia's lynch target.Ideal course of action IMO is to keep Not_Mafia as a compromise lynch, continue discussions - find out what A50/tictac/Not_Mafia think outside of that exchange, for starters.I know I scumread tictac earlier, and still do - but I'm not okay with him possibly being hammered by A50. I find it hard to judge if the A50/Not_Mafia versus DVa/tictac argument is emotionally driven or if there are scum motivations. The info we have right now isn't easy to work off of either. If tictac/DVa's claims that A50/Not_Mafia surviving can derail town co-ordination and mess it up are true, then Not_Mafia is a better choice.I'd love to hear opinions from other players on this as well.

Isolated for this game, it appears the least town, but meta considered it's null. Policy being ""He trolls in D1/2 and quickhammers which could screw town, therefore let's lynch early"".

"The simplest explanation looking at their play then is indeed that pk was cured. Gobbles as scum also could just easily claim a track to an infect, maybe thinking that would bring him some towncred?

			",scum,covid
"I don't think LQ is ever a good infect target by any standard. Also I don't believe Pisskop would pick up on Alch crumbing that quickly and play along instantly. Even then he claimed infected for a full day, and there was every legitimate chance town would wanna lynch him. You think he believes a ""I was cured lmao!"" gambit would work on D3 for him?

			",scum,covid
"I think as long as Ari votes with us on Gob or Cheeky he gets a pass.

The only benefit to scum would be that they're spared for the day; but otherwise it's just more difficult for them because they need one more phase to reach parity.

He was also my scum Mason buddy in Boon's game, where he got himself visibly townread by play long before the Mason play anyway.I do recall multiple instances of ""flashes of solving"" from Hoctac, and I think he definitely would be doing *more* to get townread as scum here.

Yes, I'm aware of Masons and Mafia as well. I honed in quite confidently on scum Pops (and mistakenly Suji) and began hyperposting/tunneling. I can't just at-will launch into that style until I get a good handle on the game in some form. As scum I almost always posted in high volumes (it's much  easier making up legit-sounding stuff) excluding one singular game (and with good reason). I'm not able to find a good point of re-calibration and I'm only confident about some townreads.Let's get there - wanna talk about any slot?

Infected will be pushing randomly and may fail to align with scum, so a bunch of infected people in thread may not allow a favorable outcome (since they can end up lynching each other as well and it feels better for scum to lynch town over infected). There's also the fact that this mechanic allows an indirect threat to infected people. If you're infected and you play to town win-con anyway, scum can kill you and lock you as that alignment with no chance of a cure. There could be roles that can be killed only upon infection.

The fact that it statistically makes sense for me to have made a mistake or two doesn't invalidate the approach itself, nor do I think it's naive  It's subject to refinement over the course of the game anyway. Townread status is one that has to be maintained.@Nero: I would still think Oka is town. A scumflip in Jake/Quick would lock him town. I don't really see ""restricting discussion between two slots"" as a legitimate scum strategy Oka would follow. For that to be the case, town would have to have been progressing towards an accurate direction for scum!him to want to shift back focus: what would be your assessment then?

"Hey y'all who's in the mood to read another wallpost???@Tchill: I'll summarize what your case on Mastina seems to be.1. An incorrect application of ETL's meta; and BoP.2. A contradiction between ""I can't gauge ETL's meta years later"", and ""I've seen ETL AtE as either alignment"".3. Exhibiting overconfidence, leading town to believe ETL was playing a good scum game.4. Assigning blame to ETL if she was town.5. Entertaining setup spec from a scumread.And my responses:1. Incorrect in hindsight, a little legitimate: but damning? I certainly don't think so. With ETL's behavior, I won't be surprised at someone experienced with her also scumreading her this game. ETL went on that weird emotional tangent right after four votes, and it just got a lot worse with time. 2. That's not a contradiction. Meta can change, but that doesn't mean you ignore that a slot did AtE as scum before - the capabilities remain. 3. Yes, I believed it was a good scum move (up to one point) to throw out pre-emptive AtE. I've seen scum do it recently, townread them, and had them go on to win the game. Such extended self-voting AtE plays are objectively pretty bad if town, and can work out well when scum. Besides, is there any special scum motivation in looking as though you have a super confident read on a player you were once familiar with, only for them to flip town, versus being a little more subtle about it? 4. Yes, ETL does deserve some blame. I understand that she felt unimportant and unheard while being attacked, and that led her to behave that way; but that doesn't mean the people pushing her deserve that blame. If Mastina wanted to ""avoid responsibility"", it's a lot easier to just not push it as strongly (which she did, consistently) and then try to make up excuses later. 5. Why does the source matter? On a side note, I engage fully with people I scumread also - everyone deserves to be engaged on the chance they're town, even if I'm lynching them. I'd only stop if it they acted in bad faith. And if they posted some wrong setup spec like ""infected people can infect others"" I could very well butt in regardless of my read on them.None of your reasons feel solid for Mastina!scum, sorry. If you have time, I would invite you to take her up on her word and actually skim a few of her recent scumgames, and give me an evaluation on how they compare. If you find this close to her towngames and farther from her scumgames, that implies she's suddenly changing her scum meta this game - and that would be a little unlikely, yeah? The farther back you go, the stronger this argument gets. This isn't a matter of capabilities, or whether she *could*, instead whether she *would*.I think Nahdia's being disingenuous of her Saudade push. There are many examples of players to whom you don't apply the ""normal"" scumhunting principles to catch; and I've pointed out that Saudade is one of them. I feel like that should be clear just from looking at his ISO. On re-reading, noticed that I've stated that in both 3121 and 3156, yet, she doubled down on this in 3227 without appearing to take any of that into account. I don't think Nahdia should be the type of player to pursue such surface level plays. She also discarded the entirety of the setup spec discussion which arguably is beneficial in part to town - all this leads me to think she's just not putting much effort into thinking about the game. Apart from Saudade there seems to be no strong read in her ISO: feels a little like scum replacing in, picking someone to attack, and just coasting, does it not?Gobbles' absence sucks. His posts while here weren't at all impressive. I'm surprised Mastina's the only one noting this? Mastina overestimates me :X maybe I should be paranoid of her pocketing me, hmmmmmmmmmmm  Perhaps it's time to call myself a postmodern Mafia player, since I'm generally accepting of almost all playstyles (save ones which completely lack contributions / are emotion-focused / toxic).

In a normal cult game, if you play as though you want to be culted, you're also painting a target on your back (and I think it's ethically totally fine if you can pull this off without being detected, too, so I disagree with the conclusion anyway so w/e) leading to possible lynches, while here it's flipped.

Therefore, we're in the case where infected can be cured.If infected can be ""cured"", they would not possess knowledge of the mafia team.Thus, the infected have a malleable win-con, in that they choose their win-con. The aim of the game is to win. If it was certainty  that a claimed infected could be cured, and they have a honest belief that they have equal/higher chances to win as town than as infected, they can freely out; I wouldn't consider this as throwing, and I'm surprised why the mod thinks it is.  Although it's not a certainty, I think it has decent chances.-Redacted-If an infected person was trying to play to the infected win-con without outing, and given that we've deduced they don't know the scum team, how would they approach the game? How would their approach differ from D1 in terms of achieving the lynches they want?I've redacted one part  of these deductions for a reason, so don't ask To hone in on infected, simply find players who were making genuine stances on D1 and aren't now.

PoE: I have you as town from your analysis (if you're scum, you've suddenly expanded a lot on your scumrange; and there's another towntell I won't reveal atm). Shoshin is town for a host of reasons - if she's scum she's wayyyy outside her personal scumrange and I doubt that's the case. Alonzo's town. Leaves a pool of {DT, SR, Vedith, Chennisden} and I've started to feel Vedith town this gameday. 2. Agenda-driven play: I feel the nominations were explicitly to Target Shoshin and get her out of the game; and DT's transparently crusading against Shoshin. 3. Convenient play: Feel like DT settled on a Shoshin tunnel from early game and doesn't seem like he's doing much else. To be fair, though, Shoshin is a power player who manages to control lynches from BoP and players like RC/Shoshin influence the gamestate making it slightly harder to push elsewhere for other slots; regardless I think my point still holds validity.

Going by scum capability alone, Irre is the slot I'd be most paranoid about in a hypothetical LyLo between the three of them; and the prior of Irre nominating himself is also relatively high - these two reasons should be enough to lynch him now.Anyone wanting to sell me on Shoshin should show me how her self-meta is invalid.VOTE: Irrelephant

You assert that your reason for townreading Irre (based upon allowing paranoia on you to fester) is a reason you've used multiple times in the past accurately - does this not imply a good chance of Irre being aware about it? Also if your reads have been on the wrong side, this provides scum!Irre incentive to keep you in the game, no?2. You mention this: ""I spent the early parts of this game trying to sort the strongest scum players: Irrel, Auro, &amp; RC"". However, Volxen only brought up that my scum game is strong midway through the game; and you said you didn't meta-check me, and this is basically the first game we played. Did you know I was a strong scum player at the beginning? How?Additionally, if DT's town, there's reason to believe his push is clouded by personal reservations, as you pointed out. Would you agree that it benefits town if you do adapt and answer his questions, as a good-faith gesture? If you agree, then why not do that?

I think the simple explanation (barring this being a co-incidence) given scum!Fusco is that he was being honest in that readslist WRT who he felt was the towniest, and dictated the noms according to the same thought process - perhaps not realizing that he stated townreading all of them.

The admitted self-awareness coupled with it makes a lot of his towny-looking posts null in reality as Shosh points out, and the prior likelihood of scum!Irre nominating himself from being generally townread is also high. I was worried that Volxen+Fusco was a team taking a risk with Volxen's sudden burst of activity in D2; I was starting to think he was following an agenda with the {Irre/Auro} push - which would massively benefit scum!Volxen, and with Fusco's 1553. However, Volxen did begin to re-evaluate, and his droppping that line while beginning to solve between the rest of the playerlist aggressively removed any paranoia there. The Shoshin vote isn't consistent with his Fusco push though, and I'm waiting for him to answer on that.I'm interested to know what makes Scum Reading ""locktown"" as well - the tone in his posts feels fake to me, with repeated use of phrases like ""solid case""/""solid defense"".

"1. Again, scum needn't be closely aware of your meta - you pointed it out, and I defended you specifically over it. Shoshin noted it as well - so you voting Irre off that alone is fallacious.2. No; town mislynching the ""scummiest"" is the expected move, and doesn't get the other nommed players towncred for being nommed. Think about it - if the nominations are equally likely to get lynched coming into the day, it's risky - whereas having one scummy slot as a nom provides a ""cover"". 2 Towny, 1 Scummy nomination causes paranoia about the towny nominations (which I explained) which lasts inspite of the scummier nom being lynched. This is a starkly different context to a normal game; scum using the mechanic to nominate three obvtown town players would lead to a prob loss by virtue of confirming multiple town in the night phases. Proof is served by the stances people are taking today.3. How does it benefit me the most regardless of outcome? That's quite a meh nomination if I were scum. Shoshin literally townlocked me, and Irrelephant townreads me as well. Shoshin also isn't widely townread (which you agree with me on). You've played with scum!me: Do you think I would want to kill someone who's hard-townreading / lock-townreading me? Also your argument would apply to anyone scum, so I find this disingenuous.

			",scum,nomination mafia
"Shoshin, who has no meta experience with you (I think?) said this, for starters. Do you disagree that anyone following the game (which scum are likelier to do) would pick up on ""Volxen becomes obvtown later on in the game"" especially with one of the most townread voices (me) asserting it?

			",scum,nomination mafia
"This is a point I've addressed - Having three widely townread slots as noms, while being a straightforward method of deciding nominations, is arguably sub-optimal. First, because even though scum gets rid of one townie slot, the other two slots become townier if they pick three widely townread town slots.Second, the dynamic changes by putting up a scummy slot and introduces WIFOM to the game, fudging up chances of the ""scummier"" player being the lynch of the day - which did happen today. Third, induces paranoia on townie slots that *aren't* nominated - which is happening right now.Such a pattern of noms is actually cleverer. If I were scum and Shosh/Irre were town, being widely townread makes it a really good risk to take nominating myself - {Auro, RC/Irre, Shoshin} was a nomination I would go for, push Shoshin (who locktowned me BEFORE D1 ended) and reap said towncred.

He's more than capable of walling as scum as evidenced by the Lynchpin game. However, I still maintain he's probtown just from his D2 activity alone.Some questions I'd like answered by Volxen:1. Why are you locked in that your nomination implies familiarity with meta? Shoshin agrees that you're a strong nom contender nonetheless as town by virtue of being scummy and by being defended upon the basis of being obvtown later - how does this alone gives you enough confidence to vote Irrelephant without considering the world where Shoshin is scum?2. Can you back up the assertion that Shoshin was ""hard townread""? With RC calling Shoshin scum before replacing out, and multiple other slots pushing Shoshin, how is this true?And to Shoshin:1. If you were suspect that Irre was scum, why was your first post D2 asking Volxen if he'd like to take the lynch?2. Can you point to anything that makes you objectively town?

Volxen's posts in the last few pages almost nearly always come from town!him; scum!Volxen never self-nominates himself, while I can see Irre easily doing that. Shoshin, can you link to some good scumgames of Irre's, which you think has similar patterns of behaviour to this game?

			",scum,nomination mafia
"Reading Shoshin's case now and this is *exactly* what I was thinking, and echoed in the previous post.

			",scum,nomination mafia
"Also, the competing hypothesis for why you were nominated, if Shoshin is town:I think you were in the same tier as {DemonLord, Fuscosco, Clemency, DoubtingThomas} as far as scum's concerned. Nominating three extremely towny slots like {RC, Irre, Auro} gets rid of one of them, sure, but also serves to confirm the other two - so it's a smart move to replace one of the obvtown slots with a scummy-looking slot and play up the WIFOM. Which is good WIFOM, as seen in early D2 in this thread - multiple people (including me) believed you were town as scum!you would never gladiate with stronger players. Between {Volxen, Demon, Fus, Clem, DT} you're the slot that is potentially most bothersome for scum if they picked up on your ""unlynchable late stage"" assertion, making you a decent pick if they were going for {2 townie, 1 scummy} nomination pick. However, I don't feel that Shoshin was universally townie - I think it's probable that scum viewed her as a threat.Which does lend credence to the idea of Irre being scum - being highly townread makes it a really good move to nominate yourself along with a couple of other ""not so town"" slots: If the intent was to remove obvtown, RC would have definitely been nominated. Irre being the only very townread slot of the three at time of nominations is concerning.

			",scum,nomination mafia
"Volxen is probtown.Volxen, I think your conclusion that I could be scum has some faults. Firstly, it conflicts with my stated positions throughout the game (where I resign to a null on Shoshin after pushing her initially, deciding on sorting her later) - my entrance to this day also has me towncasing you and arguing with someone who voted you (SR). And my stated positions are also sub-optimal for scum me.Secondly, trying to get rid of you as scum is arguably far more sub-optimal strategy for me to take as opposed to buddying you - the former causes me to get scumread on your mislynch, while the latter doesn't hurt me even if you scumread me, since others townread me strong enough for that. Third, it is plainly obvious to me that you can obv-town it up; in what universe do you expect scum!Auro to nominate you *without* the expectation that you would town it up? Fourth, and this is important - why do you assume Shoshin was a universal townread? Plenty of slots pushed her in D1 if I recall correctly. This alone should disprove the idea that scum selected nominees specifically to disprove you.Fifth, even going with that line of thought - one doesn't need extensive meta-knowledge to want to get rid of you. *Multiple times*, and I can quote, you stated that you would be ""obvtown"" and ""unlynchable"" later in the game. I explicitly defended you by saying we don't lynch you till you've had an opportunity to post more and town yourself up.For scum!Auro, this is a bad set of nominations if all town.

McQueen's not posting isn't deliberate IMO - simply that so far, nothing has happened that poses any significant danger to wolves, so I feel like he simply ignored the thread. He was posting in other games, and even this game day has been active elsewhere but absent here. The strongest reason for him not being Mafia is the Speedwagon on him last game day - which, as I recall, had Brass, Vedith and Me hopping on it. Why would Maf!Jay bus his partner in that situation?

"@A50 correct me if I'm wrong. A simplification of your idea is that we enter the same gamestate as today with one less Mafia or Villa - with a 3/8 chance of the former and 5/8 latter. While you say the objective is to regain a villa majority, I don't think that goal is particularly fruitful - in this context, it's just us vs Mafia and I think it's better focusing *only* on Wolves now. A villa majority won't mean much as long as Wolves have their NK, and a 3/8 chance + a guaranteed non-WW lynch frankly doesn't seem worth it. The increased (Villa+Mafia) numbers are good and focusing otherwise only makes it easier for Wolves, who are more dangerous. Plus, Bambi being okay with the lynch means we're not going to hit Mafia. We're not going to hit the seer either because we'd get a claim otherwise - that gives us a 1/3 chance of hitting WW today.If I haven't articulated this properly, please do tell me.

Things started going down when she questioned me about why Thor over Egix, and I stupidly answered. The extended back-and-forth I held with Thor poked a lot more holes in my case (which in retrospect, should've gone with something along the lines of PoE and 'gut'), and I really thought Egix would reverse on his stance, and vote DVa.I think my biggest takeaway as scum from my first game would be to develop fake reads with substance.

If *both* you and BB didn't want to vote DVa as their top pick, it would be similar to my reasoning above and {Thor, BB} as a scumteam could have been less likely than if either of you did.You keep attacking my reasoning and cases for being biased, terrible and what-not.

There's one PR left, should be either Neapolitan, Cop or Tracker. (Jailkeeper would have prevented the Volxen NK) After Volxen's kill Neapolitan, Cop become identical except for corresponding Mafia PRs. Neapolitan would (should) have targeted Thor on N2, from the setup there's no chance of a roleblock so they can clear Thor if he's town. Similarly, Cop would (should) have targeted Thor on N2. If roleblocked and they don't come out, Mafia know their identity (as they know the setup) so I think there's no loss in the cop coming out. If in the above cases they found Thor scum, it's still more useful to come out now rather than in D4 LyLo, where counterclaims would be harder to judge. Now this leaves Tracker. If I'm right about Thor and we make it to 1v2 LyLo, I'm pretty sure one of me, Egix would be NK'd. (One reason being if either of BB/DVa are, this implicates the other in the D4 LyLo) We'd have to find the correct scum within {BB, DVa} and if one of us is tracker, we would have a sure result as the remaining scum *has* to perform the NK. So if the other PR is tracker (which I'll assume if no Cop/Neapolitan comes out) and tracker is one of {Me, Egix}, not coming out brings our winning chances to 75%. If tracker is one of {BB, DVa} coming out now is good for town.

Otherwise his Lamees push can't be scum-motivated: Scum would want to keep Lamees in LyLo or a future ML, so why would he immediately hardly push on her? My current best guess for a scumpair right now is {Thor, DVa}. I'm going PoE: {Thor, Egix} just doesn't make much sense,  {Thor, BB} is a possibility although Wantsome seems like a sub-optimal kill compared to DVa as DVa's townread of BB is weakest (and the slot scumread him before, although idk if this factors in). This leaves out {Thor, DVa}. If Thor's scum and sees himself as a likely lynch today, this would also mean DVa wouldn't have much of a chance in D4 either - so if he's intending to push a lynch on DVa (what I make of his last post), the bussing would help their wincon in D4 LyLo.I'll try to make an all-round VCA+NKA in the morning, but right now I'm pretty confident Thor's scum.

If {Thor, Lamees} were scum, it's possible that he asked Lamees to wait and see if Volxen got to L-1 again, or else make Lamees bring Volxen to L-1 himself. Given my suspicion seemed to be pretty strong on you and I was considering an intent to hammer after further analysis, whether it was Thor or Lamees on L-1 wouldn't make a difference to me. If only Thor was scum and Lamees wasn't, if Thor had predicted that the final wagons to choose from would be Volxen or Trendall (One reason pointing towards this is his saying ""Vote Volxen if you think he's scum, vote Trendall otherwise""). Even in the then less likely case of people voting for Trendall led to a ML on him, it wouldn't affect anyone's suspicions on him for the worse.Point being, the operating assumption could be a much simpler ""This will lead to Volxen v Trendall, and because I see more pressure on Volxen, should lead to a lynch/claim ultimately"", rather than a short-term ""I'm confident someone will replace me as an L-1 voter right after I leave"".   I'll give more thought to who I think his likely partners could be, if he was indeed scum. I mentioned Lamees because that seemed like a decent explanation of why he'd leave your wagon before someone announced an intent to hammer, but I'm not really fixed on this idea because of my townread on Lamees.

Just before Thor left your wagon I was considering announcing intent to hammer for you, but on a somewhat weaker basis since I was uncomfortable with that. Thor's leaving actually gave me some space to cast a vote on you without it being a hammer.

"@Volxen, For me it was the theory suspicion plus the assumption of scum!Thor could explain most of his actions:Sheeping BB for a long time (He sheeps as town too, but here it gives lesser information).The wagon switch to put Volxen at L-1.Under the pretext of pushing for a lynch well before the deadline, prodding others to ""vote for Volxen if you think he's scum, Trendall if you think he's town"". (scum!Thor might have predicted that this either of the two would be lynched ultimately, win-win. Even better if Volxen got lynched and flipped)Not listing reasons for voting Trendall specifically at time of voting. (Brilliant if scumplay actually IMO, because no one would vote Trendall for a while and this could put pressure on Volxen..)Singling out of Trendall on what seems to be towny play. (This is based off my personal townread of Trendall though)The only non-scummy play of his, as you correctly pointed out, is his switching wagons from Volx at L-1 before a claim. The only explanations to this I can see from a scum!Thor perspective are that he read my apprehension at hammering you, and predicted that leaving the wagon and prodding to vote would make me put you back at L-1. An even bigger stretch would be a {Thor, Lamees} scum team. Although I soft townread Lamees, this could definitely be a possibility. I can imagine scum!Thor asking scum!Lamees to announce an intent to hammer and get Volxen to claim anyway.I'm townreading Trendall because I honestly think Trendall wouldn't have pushed on with the same arguments (which I find rather petty and nitpicky) even after many of us voiced disagreements. Trendall's anti-stat position isn't unique to this game, and I vaguely recall someone pointing out that he's had arguments of this type in previous games too. Just seems like poor strategy to spend 5 pages on a ""I have a problem with 'definite' "" argument, when there are arguably much better attacks. He could've built upon Egix/BB's arguments, for example.So if it comes down to Trendall and Thor, I think I'm sticking to Thor.

"Sorry, got struck with a cold and baaad sore throat. Read the posts and here's my thoughts: 1. @Volxen: Indeed I think one of {Egix, BB, Thor} is suspect, with an 87% chance -- more than enough to take a chance and hunt for scum there. You're not town-confirmed yet, though, but given the lack of counter-claims and the fact that we'd probably know after N1 anyway, I think I'll safely make the assumption you're Doc.2. I find the heavy opposition to statistics and vote analysis disturbing. Those are powerful weapons, and to me far more reliable than finding fault with someone's playstyle - as seems to be happening a lot here.3. I find many exhibiting town and scum-like behaviour. Following from (1) though, I'll restrict my analysis to the three in that set.4. @Trendall: Indeed there's a possibility of the 13% happening and scum not being present on both wagons, but don't you feel that it's wise to focus on that set? Your scumreads are based on information that lets you assign higher probabilities to someone being scum, and that's what makes you vote for them. The 87% statistic here lets me assign *much* higher probabilities on ""one of the three is scum"", thus making it very reasonable to start there.5. @Volx: I'm not completely fine with Egix's role in your wagon, but one fact still stands out: If he was scum, I can't imagine why he'd abandon my wagon quickly at L-1. FMPOV from this alone, I'll eliminate Egix from the set.6. I agree with BB in that he's being attacked just for his playstyle. I'll be more convinced if there's proof he doesn't do this. He does agree on the legitimacy of Volxen's statistics. His reads seem town-y to me, for example calling out lurkers. It's possible a wagon formed on him for his own scumreads.@BB: It's not that we intend to randomly pick one from the set and lynch because statistics, rather use it as a guide to scumhunt given the likelihood of scum being in the set. 7. This leaves Thor. I don't see any particularly towny plays from Thor, to be honest. Sheeping BB without any real reason, shifting wagons at L-1 to L-1, not posting any significant reads till the Trendall-Egix-Volxen interactions, starting a new wagon when Volxen points out he'd be suspect if Volxen is lynched... the slip-up between BB and Volxen could be an intentional slip, but I'll not take that point into consideration.

Switch from L-1 me to L-2 Volxen wouldn't carry any loss, and the wagon was gaining momentum - so he switched to Volxen with the same ""BB sheep"" reason.Volxen and I came to a conclusion that Thor would be most suspect if Volxen and I were town purely for the above behavior.

"If you read back on the post, it's clear he crafted an argument against my slot, gave reasoning, and then *additionally* said he was content with adding to Thor's vote. I didn't join the Volxwagon because I was unconvinced at that point. When Volx got to L-1, though, he began to repeatedly, confidently assert that I'm scum. His reasoning this time wasn't alien's panicked response, rather the alien|BB|Egix interactions. He states multiple times that BB/Egix reversed their alien vote, without placing that in context (tl;dr Egix's alien vote was completely random and the first post, BB|Alien scum team sounds absurds given how it played out). I wouldn't be surprised if Lamees turns out to be scum if Volxen flips scum - being a new-ish player, I personally feel showing intent to hammer/actually hammering would require substantive reasoning and consistency for it to give town-cred. Sudden swooping with a hammering intent would seem suspicious to me. Plus, it's better play to try and shift the wagon -- where it would be wise to cast suspicion on Volxen and distance, and maintain the vote on me on the off chance that the wagon shifts to me again. It's bad for both scum players to wagon on the same player, but in this case there's probably no other option.If Volxen's lynched and flips scum, that would be convincing enough that the five lynching him are mostly town, and the remaining set would be at least 2 out of [Lamees, NotNova, Wantsome]. Both Lamees and Wantsome have established strong scumreads on me (I'm second to Volxen for Wantsome and the scummiest to Lamees), and I'd be suspicious of both of them. Although using statistics for future predictions (the final vote) sorta ruins this and could prod scum to behave in reverse, I'd have a look out for the hammering voter as well.If Volx flips town, the statistic that it's rare for an all-town lynch makes sense. [Thor, BB, Egix, Trendall] should very likely contain a scummy member. I don't think both scum would be on this wagon though as most of them were on both his and my wagons, so the other might be in [Lamees, NotNova, Wantsome]. In either case (Volx flipping town/scum if lynched), given that some information should be gained in the night, it makes sense to analyze this further then.I'm pretty suspicious of Volxen (+Lamees to a small extent) right now strongly because it looks like he's attempting to shift the wagon back to me, and the previous behaviour of quickly putting my slot at L-1, etc seems fishier with this context. I don't think I'm as strong on the Lamees slot right now (I'm going to be strongly suspicious of Lamees if Volxen flips scum anyway), but I want to be very sure before possibly announcing intent to hammer Volx.

I still disagree that funny/chummy initially is strongly scummy behaviour, also for reasons similar to the above - considering the mafia's private thread, choosing to be actively funny initially for strategic reasons seems like something that would've been discussed first, and discouraged if it was a widely known fact that scum often does this.Side question @Thor, would the above be classified as WIFOM arguments?

This seems cool, though  I'll list out a few thoughts (of mine, and others on the thread I agree with) as I read through the posts:- Rough start for my predecessor (is there a better term?), although it looks to me like an excited attempt to start off on a casual, funny note. I can't imagine why it triggered instant suspicion from BBmolla; if anything, it's kinda scary how simple activeness and excitement could put you in a scummy spotlight instantly. How come BBmolla hasn't been questioned on his intentions further by the rest?- I don't think Thor's sheeping is scummy, additionally because since he explicitly stated so. If anything, this makes me slightly more inclined to believe Thor is town, as it seems it might be a greater risk as mafioso since it's expected that people would question it soon.- Arguments against alien have brought up his defensiveness and quickness to attack accusers. I can understand his frustrations at the votes piling up after BBmolla's ""100%"" post. I can also see how this could appear as scummy behaviour, although I'll also point out that the rapid ""I blame you for blaming me"" behaviour is consistent with panicky defensiveness. If alien (me) (we?) were mafioso, wouldn't it be easier to realize that the deflections could be damaging?- The arguments against Volxen's mixed reasoning aren't convincing to me. He did clearly state the problems he had with alien (jumping on to Thor without questioning BB further) and additionally was fine with 'sheeping' Thor.- I would think that a good example of mafioso behaviour in D1 would be to cast doubt on multiple townies without reasoning too much, and to target a relatively new player early on and bet on the player panicking. If not that, being pressured to give a defense that would be scrutinized. BBmolla's behaviour seems to match this. The fact that he doesn't badger alien continuously and readily changes his vote to Volxen because 'less genuine' is consistent with the previous, especially with  the ""100% scum"" comment.BBmolla, was the ""100% scum, not changing my vote"" a pressure tactic?

This is a pretty bad meta-case because it's only 2 data points, one where I was scum in a newbie game and one where I was town with a damn experienced playerbase. Posts 538, 544, 547 sum up my defence to that case. Two players sheeped this blindly.2. My removing a vote from Egix more than 3 days from the deadline while scumreading him. I was thrown off by the fact that there seemed to be no real opposition to the Egix case, with Egix himself admitting to anti-town behaviour and unhealthy tunnelling. I reasoned that if he was town, scum wouldn't even *have* to try -- just sit back and let the ML go through. I declared I'd compromise-lynch Egix and hunt elsewhere for then, but experienced players actually discouraged this and scumread me for it.3. The gambit I tried to pull off.I'll include this because I agree that it does look scummy on first read, at least. I was heavily disliking the wagon switch and rapid L-1, and did realize there's potential in a speedy lynch happening. I reasoned my flip could help the game even better if I made a natural looking tinfoil ""scum-PT-slip"", because town would probably take a step back to make sense of things while scum (who KNEW I was gambiting) would have likely quickhammered. That didn't happen and I screwed up the gambit though.The case on Egix can be summed up by his own words:""I've regressed from trusting my townreads and pushing my scumreads, to just tunnelling anyone who sets off my scum radar."" (Post 462)Everything about his play seemed wrong, this coming from *both* players who were in his last game (Me and Wantsome).His continuous tunnelling and lack of engagement outside, his changing gameplay deliberately to avoid looking scummy, Egix's own disposition when he thought he'd be lynched - where he abandoned the game and voted me *just* for survival. More than 3 days before deadline.The case on me is pretty weak, and thankfully one other player thinks that, too. The case on Egix is far more legitimate, and Egix himself accepts that -- so I think from a town perspective who knows neither of our alignments, Egix must objectively be the better lynch.There's a 50% chance of another cop-role existing if Ruby is truly cop (Tracker/Neapol are virtually cops now), check me overnight and clear for D2.I'm still not happy that {FF, Leo, Wantsome} haven't really posted much (relevant content) yet or commented on the current state of things.

I think the Auro-Egix association is massive tinfoil.

Thor's personal philosophy at least is to always have your buddies as nullreads or town, and choosing to bog down the thread continuously with your scumbuddy and putting yourselves in the spotlight isn't the best of strats - what would it achieve? The 1v1 could've easily resulted on a lynch on either of us, and if we were W/W it really wouldn't have given the other much towncred either. Plus, if I was buddies with Thor I would've tried to prevent his lynch much earlier, before he was at L-1 with no counterwagon; given I began to townread him later, no harm done if I did townread him before that happened anyway.

GF isn't much of a stretch now, now that we've gotten the cop flip -- making it pretty likely for a GF to exist. Creature never said you dictated it. He said Persivul was on to you, which you responded with something like ""You think I was under that much pressure so as to dictate the NK?"" and he responded saying you would dictate, which you combated saying it wasn't your scumplay. And yeah, good enough comparatively. I was on to RB's inconsistency earlier, but it does make sense that HE could make those inconsistencies as town, and I was simply using a wrong baseline to make a judgment.

I also don't like how Mala made out my interactions with Thor as TvS, without actually commenting on the content within those interactions themselves, as though setting me up for a lynch if Thor flips town.

I can see why Thor isn't pushing for a *lynch* on me right now, looking at the wagons.8. I want to hear Thor's stance on why he's going for Leo over RB.9. If Thor's reasons for keeping his vote on Leo are weak: Lends him partial scum equity.10. If Thor has a good justification for why Leo over RB: Great. 11. Also, the *obtained*, clear stance is easier to keep track of and to evaluate at a later point than an inferred one.Absolutely not. If your reasoning for the Leo vote was flimsy and not justified, I would most definitely have something. Even otherwise -- now you wouldn't be able to say ""Yeah I was suspecting both, Leo was stronger"" when questioned about it at a later point, which is harder to form a read off of in retrospect. Now that your stance on (Leo &gt; RB) is defined, it's more useful for me and the rest of town to make an evaluation. Hell, your justification for your Leo vote is still open to attacks.""Inconsistency"" need not necessarily imply a strict, formal logical inconsistency. Strongish read, but weakish push elsewhere =&gt; This is an inconsistency too.

Potentially, if I judged that your reasons for voting Leo were too weak to not justify pushing RB, a slot that you said you find scummy, I would've then concluded that your (weak) vote was inconsistent with your (strong) RB read.

Now, I repeat -- I ask questions to figure out someone's thought process, and make observations about where their actions seem inconsistent with their thought processes, and in this case, said action was the Leo vote, and the thought process, RB scumread.

			",scum,crown of misery
"The case on MalaLooked back at Mala's ISO, and I think after her recent posts and what others have pointed out, there's enough to actually build a small case here. 1. Her treatment of Lamees' slot. She begins by suspecting Lamees in 222, I immediately ask her if she's had previous meta experience with Lamees. She says she lost to scum Lamees once. I point out that Lamees does what she's doing (including the extreme tunnelling) as town. There doesn't seem to be a response to that (apart from ""this is pretty bad""), or a honest re-evaluation of Lam's slot. Lam even acknowledges that she was ""super noob and doesn't know how town won"" in 287. The re-evaluation doesn't even have had to read her as town necessarily -- just substantiate why this meta doesn't match her town meta compared to her scum meta, OR acknowledge that town!Lamees can do this and give us reasons to why she's a good lynch otherwise. With neither of these things, it makes her push suspect. 2. Mild fearmongering on my slot. After she called my meta-defense of Lamees ""pretty bad"" and implying I'm scum ""white-knighting"" Lamees, I tell her it's informed by personal history with Lamees, and bring up the relevant game in 699. Her response? She dismisses it as a slightly mis-reppy ""meta read"" (it's not really -- it's using meta to show why someone *isn't* necessarily scum for something they did), and then says I'm good at implementing my town meta in scum games. Now, what's the purpose of that last sentence? Again, this doesn't look like honest re-evaluation of a stance, just fearmongering. 3. Her townreads. Persivul seems to be townread in general, so that's there. While DVa was pushing Mala, DLA's never mentioned Mala once, so I think that's a safe townread. Something_Smart and rb both seem to townread her on weird reasons, rb in his usual style and also based off a pretty bad ""reaction test"" (which I'm getting sick of), and Something_Smart complimenting her on ""solid play"" which I don't really see. I admit none of us have great TRs -- but here, they do look a bit political and a tad bit pocket-y. Her lynch pool apart from Thor has the otherwise-biggest wagon (Leodanny), one tunneled slot (Lamees) who she wants to lynch through the claim, and another OMGUS-y slot (Dunnstral) who she never really commented on before 945. This is not a point that's scum-indicative in itself, but is consistent with Mala being scum.4. The lurking. I think she's getting into the game now, but  posts like 778 rub me the wrong way when they're like, the only posts of the day. Her activity patterns do seem to be more when she's being attacked *shrug* This is not a solid case by any means, but I think I'm happier with a vote on her than Leodanny. If we're running out of time and have to consolidate, I wouldn't really mind switching to Leodanny and lynching him if necessary, although I still think his flip is meh.

His reaction to her claim was also bad too, AFAIR, and looked scummy. The slip made him look bad, too. However, he expressed frustration and seriousness during his DVa exchange -- something I'm not able to fit as part of a scum agenda for him. Clearly DVa was attracting votes (even if for meh reasons) and he wasn't being scumread, so I fail to see why he would go to the extent of faking said frustration in that context. I don't think it's likely here that scum!RB gets frustrated genuinely especially considering his prior play. Either he was scum playing with a strategy of riling people up and suddenly decided to backtrack in the case of DVa, or was town who was trolling around and got genuinely frustrated at DVa. The latter seems a lot simpler to me, and thus likelier. Furthermore, it's also very unlikely for DVa vs RB to be SvS considering that was one of the factors that led to her replacing out, so if DVa's slot is scum, that effectively clears RB. On the other hand, if DVa's slot is town, it means DVa herself seemed to not scumread RB post interaction. This makes me incline more towards believing that RB is town.

"Ooooh kayVOTE: TipsyHe started a neighborhood with me right after replacing in. I lied to him saying I detected he's part of another PT too, and asked him to confirm or deny. Instead of directly denying it, Tipsy surfed the OP rules and was wondering how I had such an ability that's not present in the OP. After I asked him to explicitly deny, he then figured I might be reaction testing him.I think it's somewhat scummy to react by looking at whether such a detection is possible in the rules over just saying ""No"" immediately. From a scum PoV I could have been talking about his scum PT as the one I detected so he'd have to think of some explanation or at least verify first if it was possible.The lack of a CO NK is also fishy! I think this could actually mean both COs are scum? If it were only one, they could just NK the other knowing they're going to survive this week. If both were outside they'd expect us not to execute a CO today, which is bad for them, so it's better to execute a CO always? Especially with Firebringer being a scumread slot anyway. It was oversight that I didn't see travel is forbidden after a Coup, which makes a Coup technically worthless. Pink Ball please don't feel shut down when I make pushes, you know I'm the type to push minor things.

"Well, what about on the day when both are assigned to flip-check? That particular day we could get false info, no? My thoughts are that officials randomly perform checks and only report if there's a scum flip or an extra Spy plot.

"Vigs are not good for the game! I would argue that vigs in general Mafia games aren't quite useful, but especially here, you don't usually want multiple kills in the same phase. This is because each Court Official can check only once per phase - so if you spread out the kills, they can come around to check all of them. If you entertain Spies and Nobles as vigs, you're giving a free pass to scum in these groups to get free kills and pass them off as ""meaningful vig shots"".

			",unknown,game of thrones
"Ah I forgot that you need to make an aggressive action. @mod: This doesn't apply to scum's factional Spy, right?Hmm that would throw the earlier down into the drain, but we still have the threat of town nuking all Spies if there's more than one assassination attempt. I would also policy vote a Noble who kills anyone residing at their castle.

			",unknown,game of thrones
"Oh, wait, I forgot - we can simply kill off Power Broker NPCs collectively. The only way they can perform Spy actions is by making a hidden recruit. That, again, can be counterplayed by having everyone form hoods (again, where each target is determined by town somehow) so recruiting isn't possible. Does anyone have an argument towards Spy actions being positive utility for town? Otherwise, if you all agree that Spy actions are negative utility, we can go about leashing and neutering.

The next day, whenever the assigned Power Broker is online, and say they were leashed to my hood, I can write a code in my hood and they immediately acknowledge in the main thread; then my hood mate also does so. The only failure case here is if we have dual-scum PTs, but we can mitigate that risk too.

			",unknown,game of thrones
"Court Officials have only two useful actions: Flip check, and Kidnap/kill check. Since everyone's going to do either of the two, scum lying is pretty dangerous for them.

			",unknown,game of thrones
"Court Officials can't hide, an assassination on them is guaranteed since Officials don't even have second in commands. Given that and the power of their flip investigations, scum will attempt to kill them off as soon as possible, to leave us with an unreliable minority. It's thus useful to town to make the play that ensures accountability for all Spies (in case they think it's a good trade-off to prove there's scum in Power Brokers while killing extra Court Officials, as they can kill off 2 per day).

			",unknown,game of thrones
"Spies are the most valuable asset to scum. If town commit to never assassinating, then the only assassinations we will see are the scum NPCs and scum Spies. Hence, if we see multiple assassinations happen at any point, it's a guarantee that there is scum in the Power Brokers, and town can nuke all the Brokers at once by leashing them to Nobles and have Nobles kill them, and lynch the rest.

"There appears to be no way to protect Court Officials from continuous NKs (I'll call scum assassinations NKs). With the other groups hiding, we will lose our Court Officials pretty quick.  The flip investigation is very important to town. So, I think all Nobles should go through the process of having armies travel to the Capital in parallel, and on D4, if we have only two Court Officials, redistribute their powers into others (who can hide and thus having town retain the value of Court Official actions).

"Great! Then everyone who can travel should follow this, and probably switch up castles every day. The Nobles will individually know who's with them but shouldn't out anything anywhere even in PTs.
